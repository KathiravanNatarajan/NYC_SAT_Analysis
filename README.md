# NYC_SAT_Analysis

Several datasets related to NYC SAT performances are collected. Added those datasets in a dictionary of dataframes. 

Checked a condition if DBN is present in all tables in order to combine the tables. "KeyError" Exception is added if DBN is not available in any one of those dataframes/files.
